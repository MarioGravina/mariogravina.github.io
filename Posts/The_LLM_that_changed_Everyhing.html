The day that LLM changed... Everything?

The Generative AI bubble and the arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) promised to change the world, and threatened to take the jobs of many poeple. 

In the earlier years of Personal Computing, even the most innovative devices could provide relative utility. 
Backtrack to June of 1977...

"The Apple II set a new standard for personal computers and showed there was some real money to be made....But for microcomputers to be taken seriously, they had to start doing things that needed doing -- functions that were useful, not just for fun....To reach the rest of us the Apple 2 needed what nerds call a killer application. Software that's so useful that people will buy computers just to run it. For the Apple II, this application was called VisiCalc. It came straight from the blackboards of the Harvard Business school. Invented by a graduate student, Dan Bricklin with his programmer friend Bob Frankston, VisiCalc was the first electronic spreadsheet....People who saw it and went and got it like an accountant, I remember showing it to one around here and he started shaking and said that's what I do all week, I could do it in an hour you know, you know, they would take their credit cards and shove them in your face."

The computers that had limited entertainment and use for their value, suddenly became tools for work.
